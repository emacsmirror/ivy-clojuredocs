# ivy-clojuredocs

Easily search the ClojureDocs from your favorite Editor =)


# Installation

For now I'm using `quelpa` to install directly from this Github repository.

If you want this package on [MELPA](http://melpa.org), please drop me a line on the issue list.

```elisp
(quelpa '(ivy-clojuredocs :repo "wandersoncferreira/ivy-clojuredocs" :fetcher github))
```

Happy hacking!
